# TETARA-Blockchain Network

**HYBRID MODULAR BLOCKCHAIN : A NETWORK FOR PRIVATE AND PUBLIC TRANSACTION**
![TETARA-WHT-01](https://github.com/Qyuzet/TETARA-OmniX-blockchain-network/assets/93258081/81f19d7e-ff5d-4147-8b42-cab8785e36ca)

TETARA is a blockchain network designed specifically for secure and efficient data sharing between banks and their customers. It leverages a sharding algorithm to distribute blockchain data across multiple nodes, including organizational (internal) nodes and end-device nodes (e.g., customer smartphones). This approach enables banks to share only relevant data with their customers, enhancing privacy while improving transaction speed and scalability.

**Introducing TETA-SandBox:**

**Key Features:**

* **Sharding Architecture:**  TETARA uses a sharding algorithm to divide the blockchain data into smaller, more manageable pieces, which are then distributed across multiple nodes. This significantly improves performance and scalability compared to traditional blockchain networks.
* **Private and Public Transactions:**  TETARA supports both private transactions, which are validated within a specific organization (e.g., a bank), and public transactions, which are validated across the entire network. 
* **Multiple Organization Support:**  The network is designed to accommodate multiple banking institutions, each with their own set of internal nodes and customer end-device nodes.
* **Data Sharing for End-Devices:**  TETARA enables banks to share relevant blockchain data with their customers' smartphones, reducing storage requirements on individual devices.

**Current Status:**

The current repository includes the foundation for TETARA, focusing on:

* **Core Blockchain Implementation:**  The codebase implements a sharding-based blockchain using Java, enabling data distribution across multiple nodes.
* **Node Structure:**  Definitions for internal nodes and end-device nodes are provided, representing the network's architecture.
* **Basic Transaction Handling:**  Rudimentary transaction processing logic is implemented, demonstrating the ability to validate and record transactions.

**Future Development:**

* **Advanced Data Sharding:**  Further development will focus on optimizing the sharding algorithm for efficient data distribution and improved performance.
* **Advanced & Efficient Encryption:** TETARA will implement robust encryption mechanisms to ensure data confidentiality and integrity during transmission and storage. We are exploring advanced cryptographic techniques like homomorphic encryption to allow computations on encrypted data while maintaining privacy.
* **Secure Data Communication:**  Implementing robust security measures to protect data integrity and confidentiality during transmission between nodes.
* **Smart Contract Integration:**  Integrating smart contracts to automate and streamline various banking processes, such as payment processing and loan approvals.
* **User Interface:**  Developing a user-friendly interface for bank employees and customers to interact with the TETARA network.
